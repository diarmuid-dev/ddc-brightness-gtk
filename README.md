# ddc-brightness-gtk
A (very) simple GTK application for controlling the brightness of a connected monitor over the DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface) interface written in python.

For the program to work, you MUST be using linux and have ddcutil installed, which can be done in apt via:

`sudo apt-get install ddcutil`
